**I could not use the actual username, but needed to use "u"**
if you want to change a users permission to a specific fiel, you can use chmod.
1.chmod u-w index.html will make it so that the user cannot write to the file specified. 
2. chmod u-r index.html will make it so they cannot even see the file "READ"
3. chmod u-x index.html it so the user cannot execute the file
4. the above commands can be all done at once by chmod u-wrx index.html
5. To add permissions run + instead of -
