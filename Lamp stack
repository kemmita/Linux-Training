**CENTOS07 LAMP stack instilation**

 1. sudo yum install httpd
 2. sudo systemctl start httpd.service
 3. sudo systemctl enable httpd.service
 4. sudo yum install mariadb-server mariadb
 5. sudo systemctl start mariadb
 6. sudo mysql_secure_installation
 7. sudo systemctl enable mariadb.service
 8. sudo yum install php php-mysql
 9. sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
 10. We will call this script info.php. In order for Apache to find the file and serve it correctly, it must be saved to a very specific 
 directory, which is called the "web root". In CentOS 7, this directory is located at /var/www/html/. We can create the file at that 
 location by typing: sudo vi /var/www/html/info.php This will open a blank file. We want to put the following text, which is valid PHP 
 code, inside the file:         <?php phpinfo(); ?> then save the file
 11. yum install firewalld 
 12. systemctl restart firewalld
 13. sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
 14. sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
 15. sudo firewall-cmd --reload
 
 
 
 **Adding new code files to our lamp stack**
 1. any file you wish to create for the lamp stack must be placed in /var/www/html/
 2. so if we wanted to create a code.php file we would run command vim /var/www/html/code.php
 3. to vie this file in the browser go to http://192.168.4.58/code.php
